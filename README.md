# Repository Description: Numerical Analysis and Methods for PDE Approximations

As the team leader of this project, I'm excited to present a repository dedicated to the exploration of Numerical Analysis and Methods for approximating solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our project focuses on tackling PDEs in both 2D and 3D dimensions, employing advanced interpolation techniques to derive accurate solutions.

Within this repository, you'll find a collection of resources, code, and documentation that showcases our team's commitment to mastering the intricacies of PDE approximations. Our emphasis on both 2D and 3D domains underscores the depth of our exploration, as we strive to tackle complex real-world problems through the lens of numerical analysis.

Join us on this journey through the world of PDEs, where innovative interpolation methods and numerical approaches pave the way for precise solutions in multi-dimensional spaces. Feel free to delve into our work and gain insights into our collaborative efforts in the realm of numerical analysis and its applications.
